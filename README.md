# Virtual-AI-psychiatrist
A Virtual AI Psychiatrist is an AI tool that chats with users to understand their emotions, offer support, and suggest coping tips. It detects signs of stress or anxiety and provides help anytime, but it's not a replacement for real doctors. It guides users to seek professional help when needed.
